# Endeavour Hackathon

## Problem Statement:
Solve the traffic problem in Ghaziabad

## Our Solution

We made a car pooling app which had following features:
- Login/Signup for everyone with a valid driving licence.
- People can add a time range of when they are leaving for some place and other.
- People wanting to pool can search for active drivers in their area within 500m and select according to time range and the place where the driver is going.
- All the services are free of cost.
- More you use the app, more you get rewards which later can be redeemed in many ways.
